Total possible score: 50 points
============================================================================

Your score: 47 out of 50 = 94% which is an A

Comments/feedback:

problem 7.1: the thrust of the problem was to correct the comments, so you
   can make sure there are not too many and that they will stay pertinent to
   the code.  You did find two errors, though!

problem 7.4: your statements are true, but consider that the error "handling"
   should be in the CALLER not in the CALLED function.  The called function
   will verify the inputs, as you said, but if something is wrong the called
   function should throw an exception which gets passed up the call stack to
   the CALLING function for handling.

problem 8.11: the actual number would be the average of all three Lincoln
   index values for a total of 14.5 bugs at large.

Good job!!

It has been a great pleasure to have you in my classes over the years, and I
look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world and the
industry.  Keep up the good work!
