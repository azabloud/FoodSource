CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Adam Zabloudil
FoodSource project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Excellent job on the document.  The description is at high enough level
   to let the reader know what's going on, yet has enough detail to let the
   reader know what some of the actions will be and how they can be used.

   The justification section is also well done, since you consider several
   topics that will feed the project along with taking your experience into
   account.  There is a good self-reflection thought or two in there as
   well.  This is a socially relevant and timely project, too!

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides are really nice, the graphics
   are lovely and demonstrate what the topic is about, and you talked to the
   audience, not the slides.  You handled the questions well and made a good
   case for the social relevance and personal involvement of the project.
   Very well done!
