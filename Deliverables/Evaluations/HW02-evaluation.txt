Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.2, I see your point about event-driven architecture, but for a game of
tic-tac-toe it's really just a turn-based game with one computer player that
responds in turn to a position that corresponds to a specific set of places
on the board, right?  So perhaps a monolithic architecture would be a better
fit for that.  'Event-driven' is better for a system that must respond to
many events, not just user input.  Check out the description in the textbook
on pages 97-98 for more details.

On 5.8 your state machine isn't quite right since you are allowing a string
that jumps directly from a beginning sign to the "E/e" and then from there
to the fractional part.  This means you would accept things like "-E3E-2"
which doesn't make sense.  Further, you are only allowing a single digit
input for your digits ~ you need an arrow that points back to the digit or
integer to handle multiple digit values.  Think about the typical scientific
notation like "-1.23E+4" or "1.23e-4" or even "+1.23e+4.5" for clues.

On 6.2 try to think of similarities that can be pushed up into the superclass
from the subclasses.  Also think of ways of grouping the subclasses.  For
example, a line won't need an area but all the shapes will.  Text won't need
a 'fill color' attribute the way the shapes will.

Good job, you're doing well, Adam so keep it up!!
