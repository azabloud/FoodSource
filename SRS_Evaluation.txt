Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Good job overall on this document.  It would be enhanced by adding a bit
   of a description at the top, and possibly a diagram to aid in seeing how
   the parts associate and fit together.

-- Functional Requirements
   Very nice work on these requirements.  You have put them into good groups
   or categories, and you have specified the requirements in the proper
   Agile language.

   Two things to note: 1) if you see the word "and" in a requirement, that's
   usually TWO or more requirements so they should be split apart; and 2) you
   also need at least several acceptance criteria for each requirement so
   that you can prove the requirement is met.

   Otherwise, your functional requirements seem to cover all the parts you
   will need for the application.  Be careful with ambiguous language that
   uses words like "easily" or "quickly" ~ also known as "weasel words".

   As an example:

   IS:
   1. Login Interface
   1.1. Signup
   1.1.1. As a user, I want to sign up with my email and select whether I am
          a buyer or a seller, so that the app can provide a personalized
          experience based on my role.

   SHOULD BE:
   1. Login Interface
   1.1. Signup
   1.1.1. As a user, I want to sign up with my email so that I can be sure
          the system will validate my account
   1.1.2. As a user, I want to select whether I am a buyer or a seller, so
          that the app can provide a personalized experience based on my role.

-- Performance Requirements
   I don't see any performance requirements, but maybe I just missed them.
   Performance requirements have to do with things like timing issues, what
   is displayed when, and how the software will be maintained/updated.  This
   section was specified for this submission.  If you have something there
   which I didn't recognize, then that's fine. :)

-- Environment Requirements
   You need to specify the requirements for both hardware and software, for
   both development and use of the application.  That is a necessary part of
   the requirements document.

=============================================================================
your score:  8.5% out of 10% which is a B

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Make the changes as suggested above for the second submission, including the
missing sections, and you'll get the full 10% on this document.

=============================================================================
SECOND SUBMISSION

your score:  9.5% out of 10% which is an A

I still don't see any Performance Requirements section, nor do I see any
acceptance criteria for your user stories.  Still, you did make some effort
to update.
